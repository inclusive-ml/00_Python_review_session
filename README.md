# Introduction

Here a a few resources to help you learn the basics of python and python for datascience that you will need in this cursus. 

We recommend that you 

1. get a quick browse of "just-enough-python"
2. move on to koans. Do them all in our first week. 
3. rapidly read over numpy and pandas (we will come back to that in later lessons)
4. glimpse over the other files. These are resources for when you might need them later. Simply have a check about what the resources are and what help they might provide you with. 
5. glimpse over the cheatsheet and pick the ones that are the most useful to you as a function of what you are already familiar with

# Bonus

If you have time, here is yet another resource for a quick review of all aspects of the python language.
